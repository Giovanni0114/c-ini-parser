### INI File Format Standard

#### Overview
INI (Initialization) files are simple text-based configuration files commonly used to store settings for applications. They consist of sections, each containing key-value pairs.

#### Syntax
- INI files are text files encoded in ASCII or UTF-8.
- Lines starting with a `;` or `#` are considered comments and ignored.
- Sections are enclosed in square brackets `[section_name]`.
- Key-value pairs are written as `key=value`.
- Whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) surrounding section names, keys, and values are ignored.
- Keys are case-insensitive, but section names are case-sensitive.

#### Example
```ini
; This is a sample INI file

[General]
; General settings
name = My Application
version = 1.0
author = John Doe

[Network]
# Network settings
hostname = example.com
port = 8080
```

#### Guidelines
- Organize settings into meaningful sections for clarity and maintainability.
- Use comments to document settings and provide context for users.
- Avoid special characters in section names, keys, and values to ensure compatibility across platforms and parsers.
- Follow a consistent naming convention for keys and section names to enhance readability.
- When parsing INI files, handle errors gracefully, such as missing sections or keys, to provide meaningful feedback to users.
